# swift-snippets
A collection of Swift snippets

## "Installation"
Navigate to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/` and copy-paste the snippets from the Snippet directory into the folder. If the `CodeSnippets` folder doesn't already exist simply create it.

Restart Xcode and everything should be working :]

## Usage
All snippets start with `mf-` followed by their name. Typing `mf-` will show you all available snippets for your current scope.
